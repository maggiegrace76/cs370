For this project, I was given starter code that set up the basic structure of the program and environment. My role was to build on top of that by creating the main logic and filling in the parts that handled decision-making, data processing, and interactions. The code I wrote included the functions, algorithms, and supporting pieces needed to make the program work as intended. This process helped me understand how to move from a template to a fully working solution.

Working on this project has shown me how the skills I practiced fit into the larger field of computer science. Computer scientists design, analyze, and improve systems that solve problems in the real world, and their work matters because technology touches every part of society. When I approach a problem as a computer scientist, I break it down into smaller steps, think about possible solutions, and then test and adjust my code until I find the most effective approach. This mindset of problem-solving is something I can apply not only to code but also to challenges outside of programming.

Another important part of my learning is understanding the ethical responsibilities I have as a computer scientist. My work impacts both the end user and the organization I am building for. That means I need to write code that is reliable, secure, and respectful of user privacy. It also means I should think ahead about how my design decisions could affect people who use the system. By keeping ethics in mind, I can contribute to technology that is not only functional but also responsible and trustworthy.
